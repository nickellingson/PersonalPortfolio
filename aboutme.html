    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p> I am an incoming Senior at the University of Minnesota.  
        I am majoring in Computer Science and have focused my 
        studies on stem related courses including math and computer science.  
        I have a 3.4 GPA and have experience with Java, Python C, Ocaml, and many other technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am well fit and well qualified in every aspect for positions in software engineering and data science.   
        The projects I have accomplished like my machine learning bot that used the k-means algorithm 
        will make me successful when it comes to modeling and analysis. Other projects have taught me building and deployment
        of programs. I hold many responsibilities and am ready for new challenges.  I am a fast 
        learner and persistent when faced with struggle. I will work with others to 
        automate processes and will produce scalable applications.  
        I will be a great asset for your company.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Sincerely,
    </p>
