    <p> My name is Nicholas Ellingson, and I am an incoming Senior 
        at the University of Minnesota.  
        I am majoring in Computer Science and have focused my 
        studies on STEM related courses, 
        including math and computer science.  
        I have a 3.4 GPA and have experience with 
        Java, Python, C, Ocaml, and many other technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am well fit and well qualified for positions in software engineering.   
        The projects I have accomplished, like my machine learning bot that used the k-means algorithm, 
        will make me successful when it comes to modeling and analysis. Other projects have taught me building and deployment
        of programs. I am a fast learner and persistent when faced with struggle. I will work with others to 
        automate processes and will produce scalable applications.  
        I will be a great asset for your company.  
    </p>
